In this project, I will conduct a `data analysis` on a Women's Clothing E-Commerce platform using the **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries in **Python**. Additionally, I will perform a `sentiment analysis` on the product reviews using the **NLTK** package, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier** and **Naive Bayes**.

## About Dataset
The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).
The author has mentionned that the name of the E-commerce platform will not be disclosed.</br> 
To maintain the anonymity of the real-world shop, it is referred to as *"retailer"* in the dataset.</br>

This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row represents customer's purchase along with the review they posted on the E-commerce site.
